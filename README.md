## üìã Project Overview

The Professional Certificate Generator is a web application that allows users to create high-quality, customized certificates for different organizations, courses, and industries. Using AI to simulate web scraping, the application generates certificates with designs that match the branding and style of well-known organizations like AWS, Coursera, Udemy, Google, and more.

Key features:
- Generate certificates for various organizations with unique designs
- Customize recipient name, certificate category, and industry/field
- Download generated certificates as images
- View the code used to create each certificate
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- Internet connection (for loading external resources)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/certificate-generator.git
```

2. Open the project:
```bash
cd certificate-generator
```

3. Launch the application:
   - Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser
   - Or use a local server like Live Server in VS Code

4. Optional: Configure the API key
   - Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
   - Add your API key to `js/config.js` or use the UI to enter it
   - Without an API key, the application will use pre-defined templates

## üß† How It Works

The certificate generator follows a streamlined process:

1. **User Input**: Users provide the certificate category (e.g., "AWS", "Coursera"), industry/field (e.g., "Data Science", "Web Development"), and recipient name.

2. **AI Processing**: The application uses the Gemini API to simulate web scraping and gather certificate designs based on the provided information:
   - The `WebScraperService` class sends a request to the Gemini API
   - If an API key is not provided, it falls back to predefined templates
   - Each organization has a unique template with specific colors, fonts, patterns, and layouts

3. **Canvas Rendering**: The certificate design is rendered on an HTML5 Canvas:
   - The `CertificateGenerator` class handles the rendering process
   - It applies the organization's unique design elements (borders, watermarks, textures)
   - It positions elements based on the layout style (centered, horizontal, asymmetric)
   - It adds the recipient name, certificate text, and signatures

4. **Final Output**: The rendered certificate is displayed to the user and can be downloaded as an image.
