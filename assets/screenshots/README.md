# Certificate Screenshots

This directory is for storing screenshots of the generated certificates to include in the main README.md file.

## How to Add Screenshots

1. Generate each certificate type in the application:
   - PrepInsta Certificate
   - Udemy Certificate
   - AWS Certificate
   - Nptel Certificate
   - Coursera Certificate

2. Take screenshots of each certificate

3. Save the screenshots with these filenames:
   - `prepinsta-certificate.png`
   - `udemy-certificate.png`
   - `aws-certificate.png`
   - `nptel-certificate.png`
   - `coursera-certificate.png`

4. Place all screenshots in this directory

The main README.md file already contains references to these filenames, so they will automatically be displayed once added.
